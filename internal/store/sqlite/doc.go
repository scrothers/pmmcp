// Package sqlite implements store.ProcessStore with pure-Go modernc.org/sqlite.
// Open is daemon-only. Migrations advance the schema for process rows, restart chain links, and
// related tables. DB() exposes the shared pool for event and audit SQLite logs. CLI processes must
// not import this package.
